1. Main Attributes

  a. Power Rate     Rate of power production per timestep. Affected by heat.
  b. Power Flow     Strength of power supply.
  c. Power Capacity Amount of power that can be stored.
  d. Heat Rate      Amount of heat produced per timestep.

1.1 Power Rate

  The rate at which power is produced or consumed.

2. Device Types

  a. Generator      Produces power and generates heat as a side product. Has a 
                    relatively small power capacity. The power flow limits the 
                    size of power consuming devices that can be connected. Heat
                    reduces the efficiency and power production can be 
                    negatively or positively affected by a presence or lack 
                    thereof.

  b. Battery        Consumes and produces power at the same rate it is charged 
                    with, up to a maximum capacity. Won't start charging unless
                    it receives at least the same power flow.

  c. Radiator       

  d. Thruster       Consumes power at a set rate while demanding a minimum power
                    flow in order to operate. Thrust is a linear function of 
                    power rate of the device. It consumes power only when 
                    switched on.

  e. Shield
